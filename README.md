# Water Footprint Analyzer

This project is a web application built with React to analyze users' water footprints. It allows users to view a list of users along with their water footprint data and find the winners in three categories: most saved water, most visitors, and most decreased value from total value to current total value.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies by running `npm install` in the project directory.
3. Run the app in development mode with `npm start`.
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

The page will automatically reload when you make changes to the code. Any lint errors will be shown in the console.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can use the following scripts:

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. You can run unit tests to ensure the application works as expected.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. The production build is optimized for better performance and includes minification. Your app will be ready for deployment after running this command.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and give you full control over configuration files and dependencies. It is recommended for advanced users who want to customize the build process.
